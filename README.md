# Harry Potter API Consumer Using SAP CAP

## About this project
This project was part of my summer lab work at university, aimed at gaining hands-on experience in full-stack application development using SAP frameworks.
The goal was to explore different frameworks such as SAP CAP and SAPUI5 while integrating an external API. For the backend, I used SAP CAP to fetch data from an external API and create a simple OData service. Specifically, I worked with the <a href='https://hp-api.onrender.com/'>Harry Potter API</a> which provided detailed information about various characters. On the frontend, SAPUI5 was used to display the characters in a list and present detailed information about each one. This project marked my first steps into full-stack web development with SAP technologies.
